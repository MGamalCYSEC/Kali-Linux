Although Linux represents a relatively small proportion of the desktop operating system market share, it is one of the most stable operating systems. This is in part because it is open-source and employs unique collaborative development techniques by the community. A new kernel/core is released every 2-3 months.

The term Linux is sometimes used to refer to a family of open-source operating systems, but it is perhaps more accurate to use this term to describe a kernel, which is the base of those operating systems.

The main functions of the Linux kernel are to manage peripheral devices, handle communication with the processor and memory, schedule tasks to be executed, handle interrupt requests, and so on.

The integration of the kernel, the operating system, system utilities, and other software packages is called a distribution. When we use the term distribution, we are referring to a working system that can be installed, boots itself, and provides additional software.

Although Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux-based OS distributions, there exist a lot more such as Knoppix, CentOS, SUSE, Gentoo, Android, and OpenWrt.

### Kali Linux Distribution

Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution created by OffSec in early 2013 and geared towards various information security tasks, such as Penetration Testing, Security Research, Computer Forensics, and Reverse Engineering.

The distribution contains a suite of information security tools that are constantly updated, serving different purposes such as information gathering, vulnerability analysis, wireless attacks, web application attacks, exploitation tools, password attacks, hardware hacking, sniffing or spoofing, and so on.
